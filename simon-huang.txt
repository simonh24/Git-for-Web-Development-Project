Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Inline elements allow other elements to be in the same line. You cannot change the height, width or top and bottom margin/padding. 
    Block elements will end the line after each element. You can change the height, width and all of the margin/padding. It will be the full width if not defined.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    An eleent positioned absolutely is placed relative to the position of the parent element.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    display: flex;

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    display block: <p>, <h1>, <address>
    display inline: <a>, <img>
    display inline-block: <button>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    The content has its own space. The padding is the space between the border and the content. The margin is the space outside the margin. So, in terms of what is inside each element, the margin is the outermost, then margin, padding, and finally the content itself. 
    To make all elements respect the width given, you'd use box-sizing: border-box;
